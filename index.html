<p>Hi. This is Changling Liu, a master's student at Münster University.</p>
<p>My interest lies in logic, especially set theory. And I'm a beginner in model theory and set theory. Also, I'm curious about Lean and formal proof machinery.  </p>
<p>Outside of math, I love hiking and logical puzzles(for example, any variation of Sudoku) and board games. I really enjoyed playing heavy-strategy games,  </p>
